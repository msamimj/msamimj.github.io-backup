						<h3>Q. What if I don’t know how to code?</h3>
						<p>Not a problem! Our entire team knew very little when they each attended their very first hackathon. It’s entirely irrelevant what your experience is going into a hackathon, it’s more about your interest in technology. Even we are passionate about making our hackathon welcoming & beginner-friendly. </p>
						<h3>Q. Will I annoy people if I ask them questions?</h3>
