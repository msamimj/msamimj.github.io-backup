		<h1>2.MY CITY MY DREAM</h1>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>A 'smart city' is an urban region that is highly advanced in terms of overall infrastructure, sustainable real estate, communications and market viability. It is a city where information technology is the principal infrastructure and the basis for providing essential services to residents. It is a city built from the principles of living within environment means. The ultimate goal of such cities is also to eliminate all carbon waste (zero-carbon city), to produce energy entirely through renewable resources, and to merge the city harmoniously with the natural environment. Smart cities also have the intentions of stimulating economic growth, reducing poverty, using higher population densities, and therefore obtaining higher efficiency, and improving health. <br>
		Students will have to present their unique ideas of creating such a Smart City.

		</p>
		<h4>Objective</h4>
		<p>Einstein once said that “We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.” Engineers have a key role to play in creating and maintaining sustainable communities across the planet and we have to rise to the challenges we face very quickly. Knowing what we know today, delivering what we deliver today and using current tools and processes invites disaster. As Engineers, we need to adapt our thinking, embrace advocacy and business planning, technology and computer sciences, work across wider domains and ensure that cities are truly able to meet the full needs of our future and we are successful in building smart cities for the betterment of all.
